Welcome to the ThreeCardMonte wiki!

A simple Sifteo implementation of the card game, Three Card Monte to demonstrate the sifteo statemachine and various game states and cube states.

This Project has two [homes](http://hci.montclair.edu/groups/tangibles/wiki/5e556/ThreeCardMonte.html) for the time being until the end of the semester as part of the [tangibles](http://hci.montclair.edu/groups/tangibles/) project.

There are still many issues with this project that I am trying to resolve. Please feel free to contribute and provide feedback on the project. Please don't spill your beer on the sifteo cubes when testing the game out with your friends.
